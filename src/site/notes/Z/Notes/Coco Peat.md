# Coco Peat
#home/gardening/indoor-gardening/houseplants 

## Summary
Coco peat is the pith of coconuts which has been ground into roughly the consistency of coffee grounds. Usually has some coco fibers (aka, coco coir) mixed in.

Like any coco-based product, coco peat has an excess of salt, as well as sodium and potassium cation points. See [Shortcomings Of Coco Products](Shortcomings%20Of%20Coco%20Products.md).

Unlike coco husk/chips, coco peat is highly water retentive. Coco peat retains 10x its weight in water. For most applications, it's recommended to amend coco peat with [Perlite](Perlite.md) or something similar to help with drainage and aeration.
