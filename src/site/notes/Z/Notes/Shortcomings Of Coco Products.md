## Summary
All coco-based products, that is horticultural products which are derived from coconut shells, have a unique set of shortcomings associated with them.

## Salt content
Coconuts are grown by the ocean, and thus coco products have a very high amount of salt in them. As a result, they must be rinsed in freshwater to remove as much of the salt as possible. High quality coco products are rinsed at least three times in freshwater to help remove the residual salt. It is recommended to check the EC of the runoff water in newly purchased product to ensure that the TDS isn't too high for growing.

## Sodium (Na) and Potassium (K) Cations 
> [!QUOTE]
> Coco is known as a neutral grow medium, but there are cation exchange sites in coco. These sites on the surface of the coco fibers will form bonds with particular nutrient cations. The cation exchange capacity of coco is unlike soil or other grow media. There are far fewer exchanges and the exchange sites will become stable (buffered) once they attach to Ca or Mg.
> 
> The cation exchange sites in coco naturally come loaded with sodium (Na) and potassium (K) cations. However, the sites have a weak hold on the Na and K cations. In the presence of calcium (Ca) or magnesium (Mg), the sites will release their Na or K cations and lock onto the Ca or Mg. Once the cation exchange sites in coco have locked on to Ca or Mg, they are “buffered” and stay stable.
> 
> The cation exchange sites in unbuffered coco can pull nearly all the Ca and Mg out of a nutrient solution. If you try to grow cannabis plants in unbuffered coco, they will experience Ca deficiency. This is tough to correct while plants are growing because Cal Mag supplements have a strong impact on electrical conductivity (EC). As a result, the total dose of CalMag that you can provide is limited, even though it all may be going to the coco and none to the plant.

> [Buffering the coco](https://www.cocoforcannabis.com/how-to-prepare-and-buffer-coco-coir/) in advance is a critical step to creating an ideal growing media. However, even in fully and properly buffered coco, you should continue to provide additional Cal Mag supplement.
