# Pumice
#home/gardening/indoor-gardening/houseplants 
## Summary
Pumice is a volcanic rock which is naturally-occurring. 

## Applications
Pumice is an excellent substitute for perlite in horticultural applications. When used as a soil amendment, it improves drainage and aeration, much like perlite. Pumice weighs more than perlite, meaning that whereas perlite will tend to float and stratify towards the surface of the substrate over time, pumice will tend to stay in place within the substrate.

## Environmental considerations
Pumice is a non-renewable resource, which requires minimal processing prior to use. It is often touted as an environmentally-friendly alternative to perlite. It is unclear what the exact benefits of pumice are to perlite from an environmental perspective.

## Cost
Pumice is significantly more expensive than perlite, which is a relatively inexpensive substrate.
