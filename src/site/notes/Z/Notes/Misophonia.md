# Misophonia
#self/health 
## Summary
Misophonia is a disorder related to the intolerance of specific sounds or noises. I believe I suffer from misophonia, as certain sounds are intolerable to me and make me anxious, angry, or intolerably irritated. An example would be the sound of someone rubbing their hands together, or the noises people make while eating, slurping soup, etc.
