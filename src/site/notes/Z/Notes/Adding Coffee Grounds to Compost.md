# Adding Coffee Grounds to Compost

## Summary
---
Coffee grounds can be added to compost, including [Vermicompost](Vermicompost.md). There are a few things to keep in mind when using coffee grounds:
1. **Coffee grounds are not acidic.** The acid in coffee is highly soluble in water, so used grounds are relatively pH-neutral, usually with a pH around 6.5.
2. **Coffee grounds are not a "brown" component.** Coffee grounds are considered "green".
3. **Coffee grounds are relatively sterile and take some time to break down.** Because they have had boiling water pass through them, coffee grounds have very little going on in terms of microorganisms. It takes some time for them to be colonized by bacteria and fungus and start to decompose, so it will take some time for worms to pay attention to them.

## Benefits in vermicompost

The conventional wisdom (although maybe not proven) is that coffee grounds are loved by worms, and it tends to boost their [reproductive cycle](reproductive%20cycle).
