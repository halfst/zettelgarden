## Summary
All too often customer support is seen as a function to help customers in their time of need when they are having problems. However, good customer support is about helping customers to succeed at all times. A superior customer support model is the one that implements proactive education and strengthening of the customer bond rather than simple triage of customer issues and complaints.
