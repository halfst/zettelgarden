# Baker's Math
parent:: [[Z/Notes/Bread\|Bread]]
#home/household/cooking/bread 
## Summary
Baker's math is easy once you get the hang of it. All ingredients are listed as a percentage of the total weight of all flours in the recipe. For a batch of [[Z/Notes/Bread\|Bread]] with 1000g total flour in it, 800g of water would be 80% water (aka, 80% hydration).

Salt, yeast, fat, sugar, or anything else typically gets weighed in the same way, so a typical bread recipe with yeast might look like this:

* 700g Bread Flour
* 300g Whole Wheat Flour (total flour weight 1000g)
* 750g Water (75%)
* 12g Instant Yeast (1.2%)
* 22g salt (2.2%)

If you divide or multiply all the weights above by any amount, the percentages will remain the same. This makes scaling recipes easy. The same recipe above halved would be :

* 350g Bread Flour
* 150g Whole Wheat Flour (total flour weight 500g)
* 375g Water (75%)
* 6g Instant Yeast (1.2%)
* 11g salt (2.2%)

With sourdough things are only slightly more complicated, as different people have different ideas about how to determine the total flour weight (whether or not the flour in the levain/starter is included in the total, for example), but you can always check the math in the recipe to see how they calculated the totals.

Some add-ins are considered flour when calculating the total flour weight as well. For example, some people include vital wheat gluten in the flour weight if it's added and some don't. Again, you can always check the math.
