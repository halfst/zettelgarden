## Summary
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is notetaking software available for Mac and PC, with apps available for iOS and Android. It is what I use to manage the [[Z/Notes/Zettelgarden\|Zettelgarden]] (as a CMS, of sorts), as well as where I maintain my personal notes, journals, and personal project management records. Obsidian is free software, with some paid services you can purchase, such as sync, and also publish, which I use for this site.
