# ADHD
#self/health 
## Summary
I got diagnosed with ADHD late in life, at the age of 35. I currently take medication to help with the symptoms, but it only really scratches the surface of helping. Managing my ADHD is a burden, and affects every single part of my life in inscrutable ways.

Before I was diagnosed, I remember reading about dopamine-related disorders in my psychology class when I was 16 and 17. I'd read about how these people have no reward system in their brain for completing tasks and I thought that felt just like me. I knew I didn't have those disorders, but I knew something was wrong with the reward pathway in my brain. Now I know that is exactly one of the "gifts" of ADHD.
