## Summary
In [[Z/Notes/Notetaking\|Notetaking]], Periodic Notes are notes that are made on a regular basis, e.g., daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, etc. These notes are often formatted in a specific way, and may borrow elements from bullet journaling. The particulars of a periodic notes system varies from one [PKM](Personal%20Knowledge%20Management%20(PKM).md) to the next. Some people choose do the majority of their notetaking in their periodic notes and then refactor into [Atomic Notes](Atomic%20Notes.md) from there, whereas other people may keep their periodic notes more focused on simple journaling.

## My Approach To Periodic Notes
Currently in [my PKM](Lucid%20Drunkenness.md), I maintain daily notes and weekly notes. 
### Daily Notes
My daily notes are largely a place to record my emotions, log some daily info I'm tracking, and record major life events as they happen. My notes are very journal-oriented. I complete my daily notes at the end of each day. I track the following each day: number of hours slept, time spent meditating, whether or not I exercised, whether or not I took my medication, my depression, anxiety, mood, and energy levels from 1-10, and three words to describe my emotions that day.

Then I note any books I read that day, record any major project updates, and finally record a brief journal entry of any life events or interesting things that happened during the day.
### Weekly Notes
Weekly notes have a different focus than daily notes. The point of weekly notes is to summarize useful information from the daily notes of the prior week. Additionally, I record accomplishments of the prior week and set three major goals for the upcoming week. This is part of my [Weekly Planning](Weekly%20Planning.md).
