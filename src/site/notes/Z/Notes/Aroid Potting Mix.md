# Aroid Potting Mix
parent:: [[Z/Notes/Aroids\|Aroids]]

## Summary
[Aroids](Aroids.md) like a chunky, airy potting mix with plenty of big hunks of stuff for their roots to grip onto. A mix full of plenty of chunks of bark, coco chips, or other large, bulky materials will help them to develop strong, thick roots that will help them climb and develop bigger and better foliage. Additionally, ingredients which provide lightness and prevent compaction will ensure plenty of oxygen get to the roots to help promote health and prevent root rot.

A good aroid potting mix can also be suitable for [hoyas](hoyas), and other [Epiphytes](Epiphytes.md).

## Recipes
Below are some various aroid potting mix recipes I've encountered.

#### Growplant.ca Recipe
- 1 part [orchid bark](orchid%20bark)
- 1 part [Perlite](Perlite.md)
- 1 part [peat moss](peat%20moss)

I think this recipe has too much peat and not enough orchid bark, as well as no source of bacteria, such as [Vermicompost](Vermicompost.md).

#### Aroidwiki.com
-   1 part [worm castings](Vermicompost.md)
-   2 parts Potting Mix
-   3 parts [Perlite](Perlite.md)
-   4 parts Orchid Bark

#### Sean William Salim's Chunky Aroid Mix
- (6 parts) [Coco Husk](Coco%20Husk.md)
- (1 part) Twigs
- (4 parts) Perlite
- (1 part) Worm castings
- (1 part) Horticultural Charcoal
- (2 parts) Burnt Rice husks

He doesn't provide ratios for his mix, so I've estimated the amounts listed in the parentheses.

#### Ethan's Aroid Potting Mix
- 6 parts Coco Husk
- 2 parts coarse perlite
- 1 part extra coarse perlite
- 1 part coarse pumice
- 3 parts Burnt Rice husks
- 1 part LECA
- 1 part twigs
- 1 part Horticultural Charcoal
- 1 part vermicompost
