## Summary
Personal Knowledge Management, or PKM, is the process of gathering, refining, and organizing thoughts, knowledge, and information in a way which is easily accessible in the future. The point of PKM is to create an external form of memory, which can be used as a sort of memory bank. It can include many different practices and tools, including note-taking, idea capture, and information organization, among others. PKM can also include learning and development activities, such as reading, reflection, and experimentation. 

## Second Brain
Often the focus of PKM is to establish a so-called "Second Brain" which acts as an external form of memory and a place for external cognition. This can take many forms, the most popular systems of which are:
 - [Zettelkasten](Zettelkasten.md)
 - [Digital Garden](Digital%20Garden.md)
 - [Personal Wiki](Personal%20Wiki.md)

## GSDQ and Lucid Drunkenness
Because I am a sucker for naming things and creating systems which have no scope beyond my immediate needs, I've named my PKM methodology [Getting Shit Done Quick (GSDQ)](Getting%20Shit%20Done%20Quick%20(GSDQ).md) and my Second Brain is called [Lucid Drunkenness](Lucid%20Drunkenness.md).
