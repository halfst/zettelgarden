# Perlite

## Summary
Perlite is a volcanic glass which is mined and then processed by heat, which causes it to expand. It is used extensively in horticultural applications as a soil amendment to improve [aeration](Aeration%20(Soil%20Property).md) and drainage because it is cheaper than alternatives such as [Pumice](Pumice.md).

## Applications & Characteristics
Perlite retains very little water itself, rather it allows water to pass through it like a sieve. It also creates pockets of air in soil due to its shape and porosity. These characteristics make it very useful as a soil amendment, where it can increase drainage and aeration and decrease soil compaction.

In addition to being used as a soil amendment, perlite can also be used as a growing substrate itself. Being an inorganic, sterile substrate, it does not provide any nutrients to plants grown in it, so the use of fertilizers and other supplements is required for long term use. It is especially useful for plants which are very sensitive to overwatering, including epiphytic plants such as Hoya undulata. It is frequently used as a substrate in [prop boxes](prop%20boxes) due to its ability to wick water and the fact that it's cheap.

Perlite is somewhat ubiquitous in the plant community, and you will see it used in combination with many other substrates and in mixes. A common propagation substrate is comprised of half [Sphagnum Moss](Sphagnum%20Moss.md) and half perlite.

## Environmental Impact
Some people have concerns about the environmental impacts that mining perlite has. Technically it is a non-renewable resource, with a limited supply, however since the mining of perlite has begun, less than 1% of known reserves have been mined. Additional concerns about the environmental impacts of perlite production include the fact that processing and transporting it requires burning of fossil fuels.
