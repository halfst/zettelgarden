## Summary
Rowing is a means of exercise. I've put together a [Beginner Rowing Program](Beginner%20Rowing%20Program.md) to help get started in rowing using only YouTube videos.

## Technique
Important things to remember about technique:
 - Keep a straight back
 - Move your hands up to [the catch](https://ucanrow2.com/rowing-technique-learn-the-catch-position/)
