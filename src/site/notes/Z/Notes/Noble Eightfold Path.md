# Noble Eightfold Path
#self/spirituality/zen/dharma 
## Summary
The Noble Eightfold Path is a set of Buddhist practices which represents the path to enlightenment. It is the fourth of the [Four Noble Truths](Four%20Noble%20Truths). The 8 steps are:

1. Right Understanding
2. Right Thought
3. Right Speech
4. Right Action
5. Right Livelihood
6. Right Effort
7. Right Mindfulness
8. Right Concentration 

Rather than copy-paste teachings on the Eightfold Path, I'll just refer to the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_Eightfold_Path) on it for now and come back later and leave my thoughts.
