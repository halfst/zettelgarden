# Love Building Things And Hate Using Them
#self/self-development/self-reflection 
## Summary
This concept is that my strengths are in building systems and programs, constructing the infrastructure to make them work, the policies and processes to facilitate daily use, and then once it comes to running them I completely lose all interest and can't force myself to even think about them. I have to relearn everything all over again. I'm pretty sure it's related to my [ADHD](ADHD.md).
