## Summary
Buddha doesn't call us to some mystical place when he calls us to Nibbāna, he simply asks us to wake up. All of us are born into this world half dead to it, [^1] unaware of what is going on around us, pulled down by [Duhkha](Duhkha). By embracing the [Noble Eightfold Path](Noble%20Eightfold%20Path.md), we can break the cycle of  Saṃsāra, and awake to the surrounding realities. 

[^1]: In truth, children are actually much more able to embrace the tenets and practices of Buddhism, as their minds are less clouded by years of the facade of reality we have become inundated with. Children tend to have an easier time meditating, for example. In fact, the moment the Buddha reached enlightenment was during a period when he was meditating like he did as a child.
