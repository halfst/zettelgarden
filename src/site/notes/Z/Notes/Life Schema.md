# Life Schema

# Life Schema
The Life Schema is a tool used to categorize and sort all aspects of my life in a pseudo-ontological manner. It provides a framework to organize all aspects of my life: from thoughts, ideas, and notes to goals, projects, and tasks. It also provides a filing system for both digital and physical documents, when useful.

Rather than a true heirarchy, the Life Schema is a collection of nested tags. Items can be assigned to multiple

There are 4 main types, described below, broken down into many subtypes. Each type has an associated tag and reference number. The system is designed to be rigidly flexible, meaning it can adjust to changes in my life as they come, however the types should generally remain consistent over time, as the system has been designed to be exhaustive.

## Main Types
### Self
Self notes are defined as notes which primarily are impacted by and affect items within my personal life. This can be things related to personal discipline and habits, such as exercise routine, meditation, or life organization. This can also include personal journals, diary, and other writings generally not meant for consumption by others. Finally, this category can also include creative pursuits and personal interests.

### Home
Home notes are defined as things that affect and are impacted by my immediate family, concerning the physical house itself or the household. This also includes notes related to parenting, spousal relationships, etc. These writings could be personal in nature but concerning the house or home, or they could be for general consumption among household members.

### Office
Office notes are notes which are related to and concerning career, work, business, and also other vocational pursuits. Office notes may also include notes related to activities that take place in and around the office, even if they concern personal or household business (e.g., tax information).  

### World
World notes are notes related to the outside world and all activities that take place therein. World notes could include notes about appointments, activities with friends, extended family notes, etc. World notes are related to everything outside the house and office.
