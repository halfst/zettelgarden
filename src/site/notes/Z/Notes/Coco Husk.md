# Coco Husk
#home/gardening/indoor-gardening/houseplants 
## Summary
Coco husk is the pith of coconut shells, usually with the coco coir removed, although often sold with some residual coco coir. It is used in horticulture as a pretty decent alternative to orchid bark, although it has some slight differences to orchid bark, namely, it lacks any nutrient content at all, is less acidic than orchid bark, and retains slightly more water than orchid bark due to its sponge-like qualities. Coco husk provides for good aeration and drainage in a substrate.

Like any coco-based product, coco husk has an excess of salt, as well as sodium and potassium cation points. See [Shortcomings Of Coco Products](Shortcomings%20Of%20Coco%20Products.md).
