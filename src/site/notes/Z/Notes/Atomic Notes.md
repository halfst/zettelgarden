# Summary
In [Notetaking](Notetaking.md), an atomic note is a note that represents a thought or idea in its most basic, decomposed form. Atomic Notes are self-contained, fully fleshed-out concepts, but limited in scope to one particular topic.

Many [Digital Gardens](Digital%20Garden.md) are composed of atomic notes. Atomic notes are also central to the implementation of a [Zettelkasten](Zettelkasten.md).
