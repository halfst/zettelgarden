## Summary
A lot of emphasis has been placed in school and corporate culture on SMART goals, those which are:
 - Specific
 - Measurable
 - Actionable
 - Realistic 
 - Time-bound

## Are SMART goals dumb?
These types of goals, and goal-setting exercises that emphasize them, are ubiquitous: nearly everyone has set SMART goals at some point in their lives, and yet research is beginning to show that SMART goals are ineffective.

A study in 2020 found that only 14% of people felt their goals would help them achieve great things [^1] Similarly, a survey found there to be little correlation between an organization implementing SMART goals and their employees achieving great things.

It may be more beneficial to focus on [Systems Instead Of Goals](Systems%20Instead%20Of%20Goals.md), or on [HARD goals](HARD%20goals).
