## Summary
Good goal setting practices are about more than just setting objectives to achieve. After all, as James Clear points out in the book Atomic Habits, simply setting objectives to achieve is self-defeating. Instead, it's better to focus on [[Z/Notes/Systems Instead Of Goals\|Systems Instead Of Goals]]. 

## Goal Setting in GSDQ
It's important to make goal setting a part of the [GSDQ](Getting%20Shit%20Done%20Quick%20(GSDQ).md) ceremonies, like [Weekly Planning](Weekly%20Planning.md) and [Daily Planning](Daily%20Planning.md). In these sessions, it's important to focus on systems rather than objectives.
