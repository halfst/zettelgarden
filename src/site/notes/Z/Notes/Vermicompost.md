# Vermicompost
#home/gardening 
## Summary
Vermicompost is composting with the aid of worms. Vermicompost also refers to the final product.

### Vermicompost vs. Worm Castings
The term worm castings (or worm cast) is often erroneously used as a synonym for vermicompost. Worm castings are specifically worm feces. Vermicompost is composed of worm castings, as well as small particulate composted matter.

## Techniques
There are two main types of systems for both commercial and home vermicomposting: batch-based systems and continuous flow systems.

### Batch-based systems
In batch-based systems, organic matter is added all at once in a batch for composting worms to feed on. Once enough time is passed, the worms are separated from the compost and the vermicompost is harvested.

### Continuous flow systems
Continuous flow is a method of vermicomposting where composting worms are regularly fed organic matter from the top and vermicompost is harvested from the bottom.
