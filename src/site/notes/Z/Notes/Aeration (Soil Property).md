# Aeration (Soil Property)
#home/gardening/indoor-gardening/houseplants 
## Summary
Aeration refers to the amount of air pockets within a given substrate or soil. Aeration can be improved by amending soil with [Perlite](Perlite.md), [Pumice](Pumice.md), or other similar amendments. Soil can also be aerated manually. Soil that is well aerated will provide oxygen to the roots of the plant, helping to stave off [root rot](root%20rot) and improve root health overall.
