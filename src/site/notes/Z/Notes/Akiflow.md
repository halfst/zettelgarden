# Akiflow

## Summary
Akiflow is a very cool little task management/time blocking calendar app that integrates with your Google Calendar. Beyond the typical time management functionality, Akiflow also serves as a scheduling tool a l√° Calendly, eliminating the need for a tool like that in your workflow.

## My thoughts
I tried incorporating Akiflow into my workflow but ultimately decided it wasn't for me, or at least not yet. First off, while the workflow of the tool is impressive, it doesn't handle task capturing very well in my opinion. Unlike Todoist and TickTick, it doesn't have natural language processing for dates and recurrences, meaning I can't tell it something like "Process the report every Thursday at 08:00" and have it understand what I mean.

Beyond that shortcoming, there is no functionality for project management, e.g., it's not able to support subtasks. Finally, the mobile app is still in development, having literally been released to beta a couple of weeks ago. I tried out the beta version and functionality was very limited.

I also tried to use it in conjunction with TickTick, but unfortunately there is no native integration, meaning it would have to be synced via IFTTT. I tried to get that to work and it was pretty spotty.

I really love the GUI and the idea behind Akiflow, but unfortunately it just feels like a half-finished product at this point, and for $15/mo I really would expect something fully fleshed out that meets all my needs with a robust mobile app.

## Conclusion
I'm excited to see where Akiflow is in a year or so. I might reconsider using it at that point. Similar tools in this category include Morgen and Sunsama.
