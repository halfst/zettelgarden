# Systems Instead Of Goals

## Summary
James Clear, in his book [Atomic Habits](Atomic%20Habits%20-%20James%20Clear.md), advocates for focusing on systems rather than goals. Systems being described as the processes to achieve a given objective, whereas a goal being the objective itself.

## The Problem with Focusing on Goals

> [!QUOTE]
> Thatâ€™s the counterintuitive thing about improvement. We think we need to change our results, but the results are not the problem. What we really need to change are the systems that cause those results.
> *--James Clear, Atomic Habits*

The book provides 4 main problems with focusing on goals:
1. Winners and losers have the same goals.
2. Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.
3. Goals restrict your happiness.
4. Goals are at odds with long-term progress.

## Focus on Systems instead
Focusing on the processes that lead to our success calls us to change our behavior rather than seek a specific outcome. Clear advocates for small changes (hence the title "Atomic Habits"), arguing that a 1% improvement every day will yield to a massive improvement over the long term. 

## Rebuttal
Some argue that focusing on systems alone will result in a lack of progress. If there is no direction and purpose behind our systems then there will be no goals reached.
