# Identity-based Behavioral Change
#self/self-development 
## Summary
Identity-based behavioral change is the idea that any successful long-term change in behavior must be accompanied by a change in our self-perception of our identity. For example, in order to quit smoking successfully someone needs to learn to think of themselves as a nonsmoker. Behavior follows identity, so the nonsmoker simply doesn't smoke. It's not an option within their repertoire of actions.
