# Coffee Roasting
#home/household/cooking/coffee 
## Summary
Roasting coffee at home can be as expensive or cheap a hobby as you want. It's fully possible to roast great beans with a cheap heat gun and a stainless steel bowl, or you can drop hundreds or even thousands of dollars on a fancy coffee roaster.

I have the Behmor 2000AB roaster. It works well, within certain limitations due to its design. It is programmable with different roasting profiles, although I typically operate it in manual mode.
