# Cleaning Roots
#home/gardening/indoor-gardening/houseplants 

Before transplanting a plant from soil to LECA, you need to clean the roots of the plant. You need to clean them thoroughly, but in my experience it's not necessary to remove last bit of dirt. I've found the most useful tools to be chopsticks for detangling, a bowl of clean water for dunking, and a soft/medium bristle brush for working out most of the dirt. A paintbrush would probably work great. You go at it like a paleontologist unearthing dino bones. Brush away as much of the dirt  as you can, then swish it gently in the water to wash away the dirt you've loosened up. Then repeat. You'll need to change out the water a few times as it gets dirty.
