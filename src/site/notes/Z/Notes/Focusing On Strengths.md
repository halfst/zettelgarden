# Focusing on Strengths
#self/life-optimization/project-management/goals 

After quite a lot of self reflection and personal experience with self-improvement, I have come to the conclusion that it's much more beneficial and fruitful to focus on improving one's existing strengths and leveraging perceived shortcomings as positives rather than trying to improve on what one feels their weaknesses are. This belief is mostly inspired by the work of Don Clifton's Strengthsfinder. I haven't found much use leveraging the strengths found in StrengthsFinder, however the concepts and research behind it has very much influenced my personal and professional life.

One example has been how I've used [ADHD](ADHD.md) symptoms to my advantage. The ability to hyperfocus has been as pivotal to some of my creative work as my manic episodes have been to my prolific periods.
