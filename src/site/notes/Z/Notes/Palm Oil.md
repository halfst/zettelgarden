# Palm Oil
#home/household/cooking 
## Summary
Palm oil is an odorless, tasteless oil which is the world's most produced vegetable oil, currently making up 40% of all vegetable oil produced worldwide. [^1] Because it maintains its properties at high heat, it makes for an ideal cooking oil. Since it's a natural preservative, it is used extensively in any number of products from chocolate, to cosmetics, to deodorant and toothpaste. In fact, up to half of a typical supermarket's products contain palm oil.

## Deforestation 
Palm oil has led to massive deforestation efforts as demand for the product has grown exponentially since the 1970's. From 1970 to 2020 the amount of land devoted to palm oil increased nearly nine-fold.

## Alternatives
One company has engineered a yeast that produces oil as it feeds, an oil which has very similar properties to palm oil. Lab-grown alternatives such as these are being rapidly investigated as a way to combat deforestation and the associated climate impact.
