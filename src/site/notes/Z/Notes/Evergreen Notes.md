## Summary
Evergreen notes are notes which are constantly growing and evolving. These notes are never considered "done", rather they are always a work in progress, continuously being refined as more knowledge is accumulated and ideas are refined.

Evergreen notes are [atomic](Atomic%20Notes.md), influenced by the concepts behind [Zettelkasten](Zettelkasten.md), and feature prominently in [digital gardens](Digital%20Garden.md).
