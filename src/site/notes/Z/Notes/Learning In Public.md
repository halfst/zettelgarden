Learning in public simply means to write publicly about what you are learning. This can be in the form of a [Digital Garden](Digital%20Garden.md), or public [Zettelkasten](Zettelkasten.md), a blog, by tweeting, or whatever form you prefer.

 - Getting feedback on what you are learning
 - Increasing your web presence
