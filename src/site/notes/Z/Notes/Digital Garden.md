## Summary
A digital garden is a kind of personal wiki, similar to a [Zettelkasten](Zettelkasten.md), although not as strictly formatted. Often incorporating textual as well as visual elements, there are no rules about what goes in a digital garden. Generally, people keep notes about items of interest or things they are studying. These notes are usually [evergreen notes](Evergreen%20Note.md) maintained in an ever-evolving status, never quite complete and always open for refinement.

Unlike a zettelkasten or some other types of [PKMs](Personal%20Knowledge%20Management%20(PKM).md), digital gardens are generally publicly accessible. The concept of [Learning In Public](Learning%20In%20Public.md) is encouraged when managing a digital garden.
