## Summary
Evergreen notes are [[Z/Notes/Atomic Notes\|Atomic Notes]] which are meant to evolve over time and exist across projects. They can be contrasted with transient notes, which are limited in time and scope. Evergreen notes are described by [Andy Matuschak in his notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes).

Some people also view notetaking as a process of evolution, where notes begin as “seeds” (or seedlings, something along those lines) and eventually grow into evergreen status.
