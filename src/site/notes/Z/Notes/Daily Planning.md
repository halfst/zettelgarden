# Daily Planning
#self/life-optimization/organization 
## Summary
Daily Planning is one of the ceremonies in [Getting Shit Done Quick (GSDQ)](Getting%20Shit%20Done%20Quick%20(GSDQ).md). It takes place every day, typically as part of a morning routine, and before any work begins on outstanding tasks.

## Daily Planning Agenda
- Reschedule overdue tasks and clear inbox. Assign inbox tasks due dates, move to lists, and tag accordingly  
- Review tasks and events of the day, rescheduling anything that won't be completed today  
- Order the tasks of the day in which they need to be done  
- Review tasks tagged as on deck and slate tasks for today if possible  
- 5-minute brain dump: Open any tasks I can think of  
- Check email and open tasks for any outstanding items
