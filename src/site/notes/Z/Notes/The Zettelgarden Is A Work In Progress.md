## Summary
The Zettelgarden is a perpetual work in progress. There will be broken links, half finished notes, missing images, notes referenced that don't exist, inconsistent and conflicting information, inconsistent templating, etc. Over time, the content should become more refined, but these notes remain [[Z/Notes/Evergreen Note\|evergreen]] and always changing.
