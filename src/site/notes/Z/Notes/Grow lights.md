# Grow Lights

So I've been seeing a lot of posts about grow lights and such and I thought I would throw together a basic guide. With winter in full swing in the Northern Hemisphere I thought it would be useful to give just some basic information to help when choosing grow lights for your plant babies. This is not intended to be a conclusive guide and I encourage anyone interested to look deeper or correct me on anything.

### What to look for

When choosing a grow light the most important value is going to be the **PPE** of a bulb. This is the efficiency of the bulb at turning electrical energy into usable light energy. As energy prices increase this is really important and we should all try to be energy conscious. Higher numbers here are always better. 

The second important value is **Photon Flux** or **PPF**. This gets a little complicated but in general you can think of it as the intensity. In general here, the higher this number, the more photons the light is going to put out. This gets tricky though, as it tells you how much but does not tell you how focused that light is. Some manufacturers list a **PPFD** which is a density measurement which is more useful, but how it's measured is a crap shoot and whether it's included at all is a toss up.

To sort the PPF/PPFD out you can use a simple rule of thumb. Look at the bulb and see what its shape is. If it is a standard globe shape its going to diffuse the light and spread it around. If its a cone shape or flat its going to focus the light. If PPF is the same on both bulbs, you can assume the density of the globe shaped one will be lower than the other. This really depends on your use. You have a meyer lemon you want to keep going? Get the focused one and shoot that on it. If you have typical pothos or medium-low light plants? Throw the globe one in a standard fixture and roll with it. 

**Wattage** is the other big player here. Do not pay attention to the wattage broadcasted on the amazon listing. They will ALWAYS try to list the incandescent equivalent wattage. That does not matter as incandescents are all but dead. You want to know the actual wattage used. That 200 watt led light on amazon is not 200 W. It's a marketing gimmick to get you to think you are getting more bang for your buck. Any reputable grow light manufacturer will clearly list the actual watts used when running the light. Anyone trying to hide that information is trying to mislead you. 

Some people find the **PAR value** to be useful but I don't think it's that important and is largely also a marketing thing. It stands for photosynthetically active radiation and is essentially how much of the light is actually useable by the plants. The problem with this value is many plants use different wavelengths for different things and what happens is manufacturers make a bulb with a super high PAR value and its that ugly blurple because that maximizes that value. However, plants just simply aren't that fine tuned and realistically they want a light close to the sun in spectrum. Which leads to my next paragraph.

The spectrum largely does not matter. You want a bit of all colors in there. Reputable grow lights will either tell you the spectrum of the light in nm or will show you a spectrograph. You want the peaks in the reds and blues but you also do not want to cut out the middle. The rise of cheap LED lights have lead to a plethora of goofy designs and these perfectly tuned "Blurple" lights. They work, but there is no proof they work better than a full spectrum grow light. And the draw backs, for me at least, greatly outweigh the possible benefit. I like to look at and show off my plants, and nothing kills the natural beauty of my plants than this intense epileptic blurple color.

Side note, many grow lights advertise full spectrum or daylight color. Do not be surprised if you get them home and they tend to skew red or blue. It happens and perceived color is hard to predict. I tend to enjoy red skewed ones as they feel warm. If you get one that you just don't like the color of just return it and try something else. Or use them for your cuttings in an area you aren't in. That's what my blurple lights are all used for... in my basement. 

### Parting Tips and Summary

Heres a few tips you may find useful. 

1.) Amazon is full of crappy grow lights that will do little more than waste your money. Take every one of those FENKEY 200 WATT MASTER GROW LIGHT FULL SPECTRUM BLAST SUN GOD RAY MASTER products with a huge grain of salt. Look through the description and see what the actual values listed for the previously mentioned metrics. Compare those values with other manufacturers. If the values seem too good to be true they most likely are.

2.) Don't bother with built in timers. It's christmas and you can buy timers everywhere. A timer and a power strip is way more versatile and you don't lose your timer if the light fails. And they are dirt cheap.

3.) Grow lights can be really cheap but again, keep an eye out for ones that seem too cheap. Buy some clamp light fixtures and some bulbs and throw them in there. Do not buy the self contained all in one stuff if you can avoid it. Especially those long black skinny ones that seem to be really popular, their efficiency values are super low and the density is awful. Again, you want something you can replace if need be and not have to buy a new fixture. Once those burn out you have to throw the whole thing out. And they burn out fast because they are usually junk. 

I hope this guide helps some of you out and feel free to correct or clarify on any of the topics. I love you all and hope you dudes have a wonderful holiday season filled with thriving plants.

**TL;DR go back and read it.. its cold outside and there's nothing better to do anyway.**
