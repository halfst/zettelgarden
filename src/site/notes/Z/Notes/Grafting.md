# Grafting
#home/gardening/indoor-gardening/houseplants 
## Summary
> There’s some good YouTube videos on grafting. It seems overwhelming but is actually straightforward. Woody tissue (or even green stems) can be seen as a series of tubes. When you graft, you want those tubes to line up. Doesn’t need to be perfect, just fairly close. And because there’s actually very little space between all of the tubes in wood, it’s actually more difficult to line them up in a way that doesn’t allow the flow of fluids. After you graft the tubes, you tape it together so that the graft doesn’t fall off.
> All of the living tissue of a tube is right near the surface, just under the very thin layer of cork cells (or anything that has that look of bark). It’ll keep growing outward, and new cambium above the grafting sure will fuse with that of the cambium below it. And that’s pretty much it..
