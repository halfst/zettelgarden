# Life Management

## Summary
![](Life%20Management%20Systems.excalidraw)

To effectively manage my life, I've determined the need for various tools and systems to manage my time, energy, and resources. This helps me to achieve my goals despite my [ADHD](ADHD.md) and other issues.

## Obsidian
The first of these is [Obsidian](https://www.obsidian.md), which functions as my [second brain](Lucid%20Drunkenness.md), housing my [Digital Garden](Digital%20Garden.md) and other elements of my [Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)](Personal%20Knowledge%20Management%20(PKM).md) system. 

## TickTick
Secondly, I use [TickTick](https://www.ticktick.com) to manage my tasks, projects, and capture fleeting notes (which then get transferred to Obsidian via the [Obsidian Webhooks plugin](https://github.com/trashhalo/obsidian-webhooks) by way of [IFTTT](https://www.ifttt.com)). See [How I Organize TickTick](How%20I%20Organize%20TickTick.md) for more information.

## Raindrop.io
Third, and lastly, I use [Raindrop.io](https://www.raindrop.io) as my [Idea Library](Idea%20Library.md), a way to capture and organize any bookmarks, highlights, pdfs, images, and other files that I find important, interesting, or otherwise want to capture for posterity. My public bookmarks are available under username [ejlewis](https://www.raindrop.io/ejlewis).
