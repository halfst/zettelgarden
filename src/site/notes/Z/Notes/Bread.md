# Bread
#home/household/cooking/bread 

## Summary
The beauty of bread is its essential nature: it is a simple mashing together of flour and milled grain that has been made for thousands of years. It nourishes us and keeps us alive. Without bread, civilization wouldn't exist. When we knead dough, we join a line of bread makers going back over a millennia. It grounds us in its basic nature. And yet, the baking of bread is still a nuanced art, and no two loaves will ever come out of the oven exactly the same.
