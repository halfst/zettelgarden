## Summary
---
Bachelor chow is something I created based off of a few different ideas I'd seen kicked around the internet probably 10â€“12 years ago. I used to eat variations of this regularly as a bachelor. It hits the ultimate sweet spot of being cheap, nutritious, and healthy. The beauty of this recipe is its extreme adaptability. The kale can be substituted with almost any other kind of green. The Italian sausage can be swapped for nearly any meat or sausage product. You can make it with rice instead of quinoa. There are endless ways to spice up the flavor to suit what you have in the fridge. No matter what you have or how little in your bank account, you can feed a family off of bachelor chow relatively easily.
